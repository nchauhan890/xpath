          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a language used to define the structure of web documents.
            A HTML document consists of a <span class="mono">head</span> and a <span class="mono">body</span>.
            The head contains information such as the page title, author, language and links to scripts/stylesheets.
            The body contains the elements that make up the page. It can also include scripts and other information,
            but the majority of this section is made of the page elements.
          </p>
          <p>There are many different elements that can appear on a page, including text paragraphs,
            lists, headers, tables, images, icons and hyperlinks. There are also elements which are not
            specific visuals, but act as containers for elements.
          </p>
          <h4>HTML tags</h4>
          <p>Elements on the page form a nested structure. For example, a list may contain 5 individual list
            items. Parent/child terms are used to describe the relationship between nested elements, as well
            as descendant (child of child, child of child of child, ...), ancestor (parent of parent, ...), and
            sibling (elements that share the same parent).
          </p>
          <h5>Syntax</h5>
          <p>The <span class="mono">&lt;tag&gt; ... &lt;/tag&gt;</span> syntax is used to write elements, with
            an "opening tag" and a "closing tag". Child elements are written with their own tag pairs between
            the opening and closing tags of their parent. For example, a unordered list, <span class="mono">ul</span>,
            containing list items, <span class="mono">li</span>.
            <pre><code>
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
            </code></pre>
          </p>
          <h5>Common tag names</h5>
          <p>Below are some common tag names which may be useful when writing XPath expressions.</p>
          <table class="xp-table pad-extra">
            <tr>
              <th rowspan="3">Tables</th>
              <td>table</td>
              <td>table itself</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>tr</td>
              <td>table row</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>td, th</td>
              <td>table cell, table header cell</td>
            </tr>

          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>XPath (XML Path Language) is a language used to select elements/nodes in XML documents<sup>1</sup>
            by matching a selector. Elements can be selected by using a variety of characteristics:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The type of element (tag name)</li>
              <li>The element's attributes</li>
              <li>The text inside the element</li>
              <li>What child nodes the element contains</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Unlike CSS selectors, XPath selectors can match based text nodes and are bidirectional (i.e.,
            they can select the parent of a matched element).
          </p>

          <h4>Approach to selecting elements</h4>
          <p>In order to select elements, a path to the element needs to be written. This will
            form a unique description of the elements required. Usually, the aim of specifying an XPath
            path is to select a repeating set of similar elements, though sometimes you will want to
            select a single element on the page. Below are some suggestions of things to
            consider when forming a path. 
          </p>
          <ul class="subtext">
            <li>Do the elements all have the same tag name?<span>This is usually the case</span></li>
            <li>Look the elements' parent elements - are they always the same type?
              <span>If yes, then the parents could be part of the path</span>
            </li>
            <li>Do the elements share an attribute value that is different to other elements of the
              same type?<span>If yes, then this should be a predicate (filter). The
                <span class="mono">class</span> attribute is often useful here.</span>
            </li>
            <li>Do the elements contain text with a shared substring? <span>If yes, then using
              a filter like <span class="mono">contains(text(), string)</span> may be useful
            </span></li>
            <li>Are the elements always in the same position among their siblings?
              <span>If yes, then a filter <span class="mono">[n]</span>, <span class="mono">[last()]</span>,
              or involving <span class="mono">position()</span> may be useful.</span>
            </li>
            <li>Does the selection depend on what child elements are inside the element?
              <span>If yes, then a filter involving child elements will be useful</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
